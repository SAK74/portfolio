    "description": "  My programming journey began in my teenage years, experimenting with languages like BASIC and Fortran. Later, during university, I studied Pascal while majoring in Automation and Control in Technical Systems. After graduating, coding remained my hobby and passion, during which I expanded my knowledge of Java and JavaScript fundamentals.\n\n  Some time ago (around 3 years), I decided to turn my passion for programming into a career and committed to intensive learning.\n  Currently, I specialize in frontend development, working extensively with JS/TS, React, and Next.js. I’m also familiar with Angular and have experience with backend technologies like Node.js, Nest.js, Express, AWS, ... You can find a more detailed list on the 'Skills' page.\n\n  Now I’m seeking the opportunity to join a team where I can leverage my skills, continue to grow professionally, and collaborate with like-minded individuals."
