    "description": "   I started interest of programming as a teenager. There were Basic & Fortran. Then Pascal joined in the university... I have graduated study with automation and controls in technical systems majoring, but coding remained as my hobby, passion.  Then Java has been attached, and JavaScript later.\n   At some point (about 2 years ago) I have came to the conclusion that mine favorite activity could became the way of life. So I took for hard learning! I started with frontend, adding more technologies and libraries (React, Angular and other connected libraries), and then backend also (NodeJs, NestJs, relational & non-relational DB etc.). Full list is available in 'Skils' page.\n   Currently I am opened to job in team with similar interests to be able grow professionally and gain new knowlege."
